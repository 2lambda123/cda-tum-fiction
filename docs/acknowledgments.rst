Acknowledgments
===============

The *fiction* framework is academic software that would not have been possible without the support of extraordinary people. I would like to seize the opportunity to express my gratitude towards them.

First of all, I would like to thank my co-authors for countless helpful discussions and support with this framework. Its architecture is heavily based upon the EPFL Logic Synthesis Libraries. Therefore, I thank the authors for their inspiring work and especially Mathias Soeken for letting me use parts of his code and for his patience answering dozens of my technical questions.

Also, I thank Gregor Kuhn for implementing the SVG export and for reporting troublesome bugs, Mario Kneidinger for code contributions, setting up the Dockerfile and corresponding documentation, pointing out the Visual Studio resources and documentation inconsistencies on my side, Till Schlechtweg for reporting bugs, and Fabrizio Riente for pointing out compiler issues under certain platforms. I thank Umberto Garlando who traveled hundreds of kilometers to discuss his work with me, and without whom, the iNML implementation would not have been possible. On the same note, I like to express my gratitude towards Samuel Sze Hang Ng who substantially contributed to the SiDB implementation with his insightful remarks and his support. Many thanks also go to Willem Lambooy for the inspiration and collaboration on stacked QCA and the respective implementation. Also, I thank Alan Mishchenko for sharing his knowledge about incremental satisfiability solving with me, and Nikolaj Bjorner for implementing my feature requests into the Z3 solver.

Finally, I thank the committee of the ISVLSI 2019 for decorating *fiction* with the Best Research Demo Award. A `press release <https://www.dfki.de/web/news/detail/News/mehr-als-nur-fiktion-entwurfswerkzeug-fuer-nanotechnologie-fiction-mit-best-research-demo-award-ausg/>`_ (in German) is available.
