============

*fiction* is academic software, thus, many of its built-in algorithms have been published as scientific papers.

A brief technical report summarizing the features of *fiction* v0.2.1 is available at `arXiv <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.02477>`_.

If you use *fiction* in your work, we would appreciate if you cited

    Marcel Walter, Robert Wille, Frank Sill Torres, Daniel Gro√üe and Rolf Drechsler: "fiction: An Open Source Framework
    for the Design of Field-coupled Nanocomputing Circuits", 2019, **arXiv:1905.02477**.
