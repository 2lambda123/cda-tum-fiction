/**
 * Performs logical and delay equivalence checks of gate layouts against a specification. That can either be its own
 * associated logic network or another gate layout. Three cases are to be distinguished:
 *
 *  (1) The gate layout performs a different functionality under at least one input pattern than its specification.
 *      The layout is NOT EQUIVALENT to its specification.
 *  (2) The gate layout performs the same functionality like its specification and has a throughput of 1/1.
 *      The layout is STRONGLY EQUIVALENT to its specification.
 *  (3) The gate layout performs the same functionality like its specification and has a throughput of 1/x, where x > 1.
 *      The layout is WEAKLY EQUIVALENT to its specification.
 *
 * Logical equivalence is checked with a SAT solver by extracting a logic description from the topological structure of
 * the gate layout and transforming it to CNF via Tseitin transformation.
 *
 * The technique is presented in "Verification for Field-coupled Nanocomputing Circuits" by Marcel Walter, Robert Wille,
 * Frank Sill Torres, Daniel Gro√üe, and Rolf Drechsler in DAC 2020.
